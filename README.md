A full-stack application that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as a reference during chatting. This application allows you to pick and choose which LLM or Vector Database you want to use as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

### Product Overview

AnythingLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.

AnythingLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

### Technical Overview

This monorepo consists of six main sections:

- `frontend`: A viteJS + React frontend that you can run to easily create and manage all your content the LLM can use.
- `server`: A NodeJS express server to handle all the interactions and do all the vectorDB management and LLM interactions.
- `collector`: NodeJS express server that processes and parses documents from the UI.
- `docker`: Docker instructions and build process + information for building from source.
- `embed`: Submodule for generation & creation of the [web embed widget](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-embed).
- `browser-extension`: Submodule for the [chrome browser extension](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anythingllm-extension).

## 🛳 Self-Hosting

Mintplex Labs & the community maintain a number of deployment methods, scripts, and templates that you can use to run AnythingLLM locally. Refer to the table below to read how to deploy on your preferred environment or to automatically deploy.

## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you'll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won't work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).

## Telemetry & Privacy

AnythingLLM by Mintplex Labs Inc contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.

<details>
<summary><kbd>More about Telemetry & Privacy for AnythingLLM</kbd></summary>

### Why?

We use this information to help us understand how AnythingLLM is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve AnythingLLM's performance and stability.

### Opting out

Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` in your server or docker .env settings to "true" to opt out of telemetry. You can also do this in-app by going to the sidebar > `Privacy` and disabling telemetry.

### What do you explicitly track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product and roadmap decisions, specifically:

- Type of your installation (Docker or Desktop)

- When a document is added or removed. No information _about_ the document. Just that the event occurred. This gives us an idea of use.

- Type of vector database in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider.

- Type of LLM provider & model tag in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider or model, or combination thereof. eg: reasoning vs regular, multi-modal models, etc.

- When a chat is sent. This is the most regular "event" and gives us an idea of the daily-activity of this project across all installations. Again, only the **event** is sent - we have no information on the nature or content of the chat itself.

You can verify these claims by finding all locations `Telemetry.sendTelemetry` is called. Additionally these events are written to the output log so you can also see the specific data which was sent - if enabled. **No IP or other identifying information is collected**. The Telemetry provider is [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - an open-source telemetry collection service.

We take privacy very seriously, and we hope you understand that we want to learn how our tool is used, without using annoying popup surveys, so we can build something worth using. The anonymous data is _never_ shared with third parties, ever.
